## Description

This is a Python tool that allows users to download images from a scryfall.com. With a simple graphical user interface, you can input the URL of the page containing the images and choose a directory where the images will be saved. 
The tool automatically cleans the image titles to ensure that the filenames are valid and free from illegal characters.

## How to Use ##

2. **Enter URL**: When prompted, enter the URL of the page.

3. **Select Directory**: Choose the folder where you want to save the downloaded images.

4. **Download**: The tool will start downloading the images and save them in the selected directory with cleaned filenames.
